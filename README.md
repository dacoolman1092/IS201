Hello! This is the FINAL PROJECT for Ethan Housley, a STUDENT in IS 201. 
This project is  culmination of my knowledge from the Web Developement Portion of IS 201.
I had a lot of fun making it, and I incorporated some things that I learned myself (like how to make changes to bootstrap) in this website.
I hope you enjoy poking around!
